# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue with Eesti Ilm, please report it to us as soon as possible by sending an email to:

**shiaulis@gmail.com**

Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.

* Any potential impact of the vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x     | :white_check_mark: |

Users are strongly encouraged to keep their application updated to the latest available version to ensure they receive all security enhancements and fixes. Older versions may not receive security patches.

## Data Security and Personal Information

Consistent with our Privacy Policy, the Eesti Ilm application is designed not to store, collect, or transfer any personal data or personally identifiable information from its users. All weather data is accessed and processed locally on your device without being transmitted to our servers or third parties in a manner that could identify you.

For diagnostic purposes and to improve app stability, anonymous crash logs and aggregated usage statistics may be collected by Apple's platform services. This data is not personally identifiable and helps us address performance issues.

## General Security Practices

While the app handles no personal data, we adhere to general secure development practices to protect the app's integrity, including:
- Utilizing HTTPS for all weather data API calls to ensure data in transit is encrypted.
- Leveraging platform-level security features (like app sandboxing) provided by iOS to enhance the app's security posture.
- Regularly updating third-party libraries and dependencies to ensure we benefit from the latest security patches.

## Changes to this Security Policy

We may update this Security Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page.
