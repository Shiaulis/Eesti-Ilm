# Privacy Policy for Eesti Ilm

**Last updated: July 4, 2025**

Eesti Ilm is developed and maintained by Andrius Shiaulis, an independent app developer based in Estonia.

**What We Collect (and What We Don't)**

Eesti Ilm is designed with your privacy in mind. We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about our users, such as your name, email, location, or unique device identifiers that could identify you.

To help us improve the app's stability and performance, we may use **anonymous crash reporting and aggregated usage statistics** provided by Apple (e.g., through App Store Connect). This data is completely anonymized and does not allow us to identify individual users. It helps us understand general app performance, not your personal usage.

All weather data is fetched directly and displayed on your device. We do not process or store any user-specific weather requests.

For any questions about this privacy policy, please contact Andrius Shiaulis at shiaulis@gmail.com.
